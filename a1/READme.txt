Langauage: C

The source code file is the submission for assignment 1 in my SENG265 class in spring of 2023.

For this assignment I was given a large csv file in which each line was formatted as 13 items seperated by commas and no spaces.
In this case the lines were each meant to be a flight and with the items being various details about the flight.

My task was to create a program that could be called with search criteria in argv such that I could take those search criteria and
print out the flights that fit those criteria into a created text file called output.txt

There were three combinations of criteria I could be given with different output formatting for each.
